# fiveRoomDungeon

> _Come, young adventurer, sit closer and I will tell you of the Foulfest Caves._ \
Traveling merchants often describe seeing caves in the cliffs south of town as they ride up from the village of
Honeywood. The pass along the shore is the fastest route but those caves are the reason they want to reach the town
gates before dark. The caves exude a dark, foreboding feeling that sends a shiver up one’s spine just thinking about
the dangers that lurk there and one can’t help but notice a stench that makes their pack mules uneasy.

The FoulFest Caves is a text-based, RPG experience for one player written in Python. This project is done as a capstone
coding and game design experience for my PTech Students. The game is based on Johann Four's Five-Room-Dungeon design
model[^1] and counts toward up to three hours of Work-Based Learning.
